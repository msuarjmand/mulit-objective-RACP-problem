## Three Developed Meta-heuristic Algorithms to Solve RACP Minimizing Makespan and Total Resource Costs Simultaneously

In this paper, a bi-objective resource availability cost problem (RACP) is studied, in which the first objective function tries to minimize the completion time of the project, and the second one tries to minimize the total resource costs. Due to the problem's complexity, three developed meta-heuristic algorithms, namely NSGA-II, NRGA, and MOPSO, are applied to solve the model. To evaluate the algorithms, a set of test problems are considered. In addition, a MADM approach called TOPSIS is employed to compare the algorithms' results. Finally, the sensitivity analysis in terms of the problemâ€™s performance is fulfilled.
